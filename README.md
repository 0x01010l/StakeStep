StakeStep is a revolutionary habit-forming app that combines the power of social accountability with financial incentives. In today's fast-paced world, many of us struggle to build and maintain positive habits, despite our best intentions.

The app's consensus mechanism allows pool participants to verify task completion, adding an extra layer of motivation and accountability.

Whether you're looking to exercise more, save money, learn a new skill, or break a bad habit, StakeStep provides the structure and incentives to help you succeed. With StakeStep, transform your intentions into actions and your actions into lasting habits.

## Quickstart

To get started with StakeStep, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd StakeStep
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`
